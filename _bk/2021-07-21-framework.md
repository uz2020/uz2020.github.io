> Go doesn’t have a canonical web framework analogous to Ruby’s Rails or Python’s Django. This is not to say that such frameworks don’t exist, but the building blocks in Go’s standard library are flexible enough that frameworks are often unnecessary. Furthermore, although frameworks are convenient in the early phases of a project, their additional complexity can make longer-term maintenance harder.
