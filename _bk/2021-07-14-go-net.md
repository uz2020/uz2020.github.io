listener and connection are both implemented as interfaces.

interface has the benefit of not being required to specify the internal data of the type. All we know is certain operations could be performed on the type that satisfies a certain interface.

we know that a listener is capable of Listen(), Accept() and Close(), a connection is capable of Write(), Read() and Close().

a connection implements the Write() method, so it's also a io.Writer. It implements the Read() method, so it's also a io.Reader.
