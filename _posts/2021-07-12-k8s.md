> Kubernetes (aka. k8s) is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

k8s doesn't work well with Archlinux. After struggling a whole afternoon tweaking networks configurations, still no luck.

Network is not to blame. It works like a charm on ubuntu.

k8s is complicated. It doesn't provide containers. It manages containers run by other system such docker.
