Worst thing is everyday you wake up, you seem to start your life afresh. You just lose all your memory, day by day you get used to it. That's terrible. I don't want to go to sleep, because I know it for sure on the next day I won't be able to pick up where I have left off yesterday.

Delusions, you are surrounded by delusions. They keep luring you. It requires sensibility to resist them. Each one of us is Professor Nash. Everyone of us is Lenny.

Everyone of us lives his life with the bondage of solitude.
