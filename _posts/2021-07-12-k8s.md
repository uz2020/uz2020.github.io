> Kubernetes (aka. k8s) is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

> A k8s cluster consists of its control-plane components and node components (each representing one or more host machines running a container runtime and kubelet.service.

> Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. 

> Containers are similar to VMs, but they have relaxed isolation properties to share the Operating System (OS) among the applications.

> For example, if a container goes down, another container needs to start. Wouldn't it be easier if this behavior was handled by a system?

> That's how Kubernetes comes to the rescue! Kubernetes provides you with a framework to run distributed systems resiliently. It takes care of scaling and failover for your application, provides deployment patterns, and more.
