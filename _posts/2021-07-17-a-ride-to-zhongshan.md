I never thought an experience of a ride could be this bad.

Without a phone, an ID card, sufficient amount of money, I set out at 4:00 pm for no definite destination. I rode straight to the north as far as I could. It's dark when I arrived at Zhongshan. I decided not to go any further because I was already exhausted. I thought it wouldn't be difficult to get back to Zhuhai through the same route I came. But I was wrong. I couldn't find the right way to get back home. I almost rode on the highway. I asked a passerby, but she just refused to talk to me. After half an hour of searching I finally found the right road, with the help of an obscene sign under the tree. Under dim light, I barely made out the pavement. Sometimes a big truck went passed me. Most of the time there was no one on the road. Although not being fully certain that it lead to the right destination, I was not desperate as long as I could see some other vehicles passing the highway on my left side. Unfortunately, the road ended suddenly, and the environment became totally undiscernable. 

But there was some dim light on the right and there could be a street or a construction site, I don't know where it will lead to. In a moment, I was undecisive whether I should turn my way back. It's 9:00 in evening, and I was sure I was so close to Zhuhai. It would be a stupid idea to give up halfway after so much effort had been made. Therefore I chose to keep going on the right. After a few hundreds riding in the dark, there emerges more light and some stores. I knew I was on the right way.

Even though I was on the right way, it still took me nearly an hour to get back to my home. 

10:00 pm, I finally arrived home. I felt so tired but I don't feel up to sleeping. The fear of the darkness in the road still haunted about me. The tiredness made me want to vomit. My skin on the head was burnt by the sunshine and it began to come off. My back ached because the frame of my bike didn't suit my height. There was not a part of me felt good.

I stayed at home for two days after this ride trip. Something has changed inside me but I don't know what.

I opened the map to see how far I have gone. It says there is 20km from my place to Zhongshan. I definitely didn't follow the shortest path. I guess I must have rode for more than 60km that night.

I want to know more about the city I live or the cities nearby. But it's different without the help of an automobile.
